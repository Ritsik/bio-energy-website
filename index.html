        <h2>Installation</h2>
        <p>The installation of bio energy systems varies depending on the technology and scale of the project. For small-scale applications, such as domestic heating systems, installation can be relatively straightforward and involve setting up a biomass boiler and fuel storage. For larger projects, such as biogas plants or biomass power stations, the installation process is more complex and requires careful planning and engineering. It is essential to work with experienced professionals to ensure a successful installation.</p>
